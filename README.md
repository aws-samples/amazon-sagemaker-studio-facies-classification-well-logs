## Facies Classification with Well Logs

Given well log data, we'll be importing this data set into a SageMaker Autopilot experiment running on SageMaker Studio. Autopilot will walk through the different models created and deploy the best (highest accuracy) model endpoint. Using this endpoint, we will show how this can be utilized with new well data sets.

The dataset comes to us from a University of Kansas class exercise on the Hugoton and Panoma gas fields, the original full study available [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098300406001956) as well as in this github repo [here](https://github.com/seg/tutorials-2016/blob/master/1610_Facies_classification/manuscript/facies_classification.md) which is licensed under Apache License Version 2.0.
